# YouTube Summarizer

Just a lil' [website](https://dub.sh/ytsumm) to get a quick summary of a YouTube video using AI


## Features

- Simple: Full Summary, Short Summary and Custom Prompt with keyboard shortcuts
- Free: Basically free right now, because xAI's giving out free API credits
- Global: Multi-language support
- Privacy: I do not have access to what kind of vids y'all watch btw LOLL

  
## Context

- I watch like at least 10-20 informational videos everyday, wanted to save some time
- There are literally hundreds of services like this out there, though they're usually either slow, inaccurate, full of ads or needa pay
- And so I initially just built this for my own use, thought it might be useful for others as well :)


## Basic Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 - React framework
- Shadcn - UI component library
- TypeScript - Type-safe code
- Tailwind - CSS framework
- Edge Functions - Server-side API routes
- Youtube Transcript API
- LLM: xAI (grok-beta)


## Further Stuff

- Ummm don't think I'll have much time to do anything further tbh, but do let me know!
- You can submit feature requests directly at the bottom of the website
